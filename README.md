## Purpose
The iOS mobile application, moodmaps, allows a user to find things to do (dining, attractions, etc.) in their community based on their current mood.

## Features
- Can detect user location to show things to do in the user's current location
- Offers pre-set options for moods, such as happy, sad, excited, stressed, etc.
- Showcases a map view and list view of places to go to in the area
- Links to the Yelp business pages for results when a list view entry is tapped

## Control Flow
- The user is prompted to choose from the pre-set options depending on how they are feeling
- A map is displayed with pins showing various locations that the user can go to, uniquely compiled for how they are feeling
- By tapping the upper right corner, the user can toggle the list view of the results displayed on the map
- Tapping on a list view entry takes the user to the corresponding Yelp business page
